                            <h3>MONKEY TRAIL</h3>
    <p>Monkey trails are paths through the forest that are used by monkeys for movement and foraging. These trails are often narrow and winding, and can be found in various habitats including tropical rainforests, temperate forests, and scrublands. Monkey trails are typically created by the repeated use of the same path by groups of monkeys over time.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the monkey trail near the entrance to the forest area.</p>

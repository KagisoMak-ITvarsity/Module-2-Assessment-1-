                            <h3>KOALA</h3>
    <p>Koalas are marsupials native to Australia. They are arboreal, meaning they live in trees, and are known for their distinctive round ears and large, black noses. Koalas are herbivores and primarily feed on eucalyptus leaves, which are toxic to most other animals but not to koalas. They spend most of their time in trees and are known for their slow movements and sleepy behavior.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>

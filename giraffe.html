                            <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
    <p>Giraffes are large, long-necked mammals native to Africa. They are the tallest living terrestrial animals and can reach heights of up to 6 meters (20 feet). Their long necks allow them to feed on leaves from tall trees, particularly acacia trees. Giraffes have distinctive spotted coats and are known for their powerful legs, which they use for defense against predators like lions.</p>

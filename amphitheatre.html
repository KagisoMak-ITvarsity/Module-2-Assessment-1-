                            <h3>AMPHITHEATRE</h3>
    <p>Historic Roman amphitheatres are ancient structures built in the shape of an oval or circle, with seating arranged in tiers around a central arena. The amphitheatre is a symbol of Roman engineering and architecture, and many were used for gladiatorial contests, public spectacles, and other events. The most famous example is the Colosseum in Rome.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the amphitheatre at pen A15, right next to the elephants.</p>

                            <h3>INSECT HOUSE</h3>
    <p>Insect houses are small structures built to provide shelter for insects in zoos and nature centers. They are typically made from natural materials such as wood, stone, and plant fibers. These houses are designed to mimic the natural habitats of various insect species, providing them with a safe and comfortable environment.</p>
    <p>Insect houses can be home to a variety of insects, including bees, butterflies, ladybugs, and beetles. They often feature different compartments or sections to accommodate the specific needs of different insect species. For example, a bee house may have small holes or tubes for solitary bees to nest in, while a butterfly house may have plants that provide nectar for adult butterflies.</p>
    <p>In addition to providing shelter for insects, insect houses can also serve as educational displays for visitors to learn about insect habitats and behaviors.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the insect house at pen I15, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
